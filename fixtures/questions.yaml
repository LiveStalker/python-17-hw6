      i think you might be a little paranoid and are paying a little too close attention
      to his every move just to try to catch him doing something.. be careful, because
      if he isn''t cheating and you are accusing him alot of doing so, he may just
      decide that if he''s going to get acussed he may as well just go ahead, and
      then who knows what he may come home smelling like..', author: 4, created: ! '2017-08-24
